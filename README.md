Following a comprehensive analysis, it has been identified that our organization employs an outdated password hashing algorithm (MD5), which offers minimal protection in the event of a password database breach. Furthermore, the current password policy does not align with industry best practices, allowing users to have short passwords (6 characters) and permitting the incorporation of usernames within passwords.

Based on this analysis, we propose the following enhancements to bolster the overall strength of password security:

Upgrade Hashing Algorithm: Transition to a dedicated password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt, scrypt, or PBKDF2. This change will significantly extend the time required to crack individual passwords.

Implement Salting: Introduce salting to deter the use of rainbow tables for expediting password cracking.

Elevate Minimum Password Length: Raise the minimum password length requirement to 10 characters. This adjustment will escalate the computational effort needed to crack passwords and provide additional time for password modification in case of a database breach.

Prevent Username-based and Reused Passwords: Prohibit the usage of passwords that mirror usernames or incorporate reused elements. Such password combinations are easily verifiable without necessitating access to the password database.

Promote User-friendly Password Creation: Advise users on crafting secure yet easy-to-remember passwords. Instead of relying on complex combinations of characters, suggest the use of passphrases. These involve merging unrelated, random words, with the inclusion of special characters and numbers for added security (e.g., mYgranny$cha1rhadstaples).

Educate on Password Managers: Educate users about the benefits of password managers. Encourage their use to generate lengthy and entirely random passwords (e.g., M>?{tk6Cfep6BrZ4J)KZWQ8j), eliminating the need to memorize or record passwords. However, emphasize the importance of maintaining a robust passphrase as the master key for accessing the password manager.

By implementing these recommended measures, we aim to significantly enhance our password protection standards, mitigating potential security risks and fostering a culture of strong and user-friendly password practices.
